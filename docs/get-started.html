        <h3>Welcome to Invana 🙂</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">We are excited that you want to learn Invana.</p>
        <p>
            Invana is a complete Knowledge Graph solution for research or business of any size.
            Model the data with in your system, import your data sets, databases and any other sources
            of information.
            <!--            Add meta data and -->
            Link the data entities in the system with relationships and
             meta data to assign weights or properties to the links.
            <!--            to establish better context with in the system.-->
        </p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p class="text-muted"></p>
        <p> It works on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph databases</a> that support <a
                href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/">Apache
            TinkerPop</a>.
            Apache TinkerPop&trade; is an opensource graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP)
            and graph analytic systems (OLAP) maintained by Apache Software Foundation. </p>

        <p>
<!--            Along with an Apache TinkerPop enabled graph database, -->
            Invana is made of two core components - invana engine and invana studio,
            which are intentionally separated as projects to decouple the GraphQL API
            and the User Interface people interact with respectively.
        </p>

        <p>Invana needs the following three services to serve the purpose ie.,
            "building and exploring knowledge graphs"  </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Graph Database: </strong> Any Apache TinkerPop enabled graph database.</li>
            <li><strong>Invana Engine : </strong> GraphQL and Python API for Knowledge Graphs.</li>
            <li><strong>Invana Studio: </strong> User Interface for visualising and managing data on Knowledge Graphs.</li>
        </ol>
