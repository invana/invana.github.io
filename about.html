                <h3>What we believe in üî≠</h3>
                <p>Information Era brought tons of data into the internet.
                    We just have to create intelligence out it, to solve our
                    problems; one by one.</p>
                <p>Just feed your problem with enough data to find the possible solutions.</p>

                <h3>What are we crafting! üñçÔ∏è</h3>
                <p>We wish to design and build a tool kit, using which we can simulate problems
                    with possible solutions and see what's the cost of loss and gain for any event.
                </p>
                <p>Let's call it Tool Kit for Brewing Intelligence for now.</p>

                <h3>Open sourced with love ‚ú® </h3>
                <p>One cannot do it alone. So, to bring the minds of the people
                    who believe in what we believe. We have open sourced our projects on

                <p>To build solutions that end users would need and love to use.
                    We believe, open source is one of the

                    and developers to constantly push the solutions towards
